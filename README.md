# Quantum Circuits and Algorithms

## About the Project

This project is an introduction to quantum circuits and algorithms based on the WQiskit textbook and linear algebra rules.

## Description: how does it relate to linear algebra?

Currently, this project has 4 files each about a quantum circuit that demonstrates some of the basics. More advanced circuits will be introduced later. I attached links to Google Colab for each file so that you can play with the values and see how it is affected by the circuit.

### 1. Single Quantum Computing Circuit

### 2. Quantum Half Adder

### 3. Exploring Qubits

### 4. Single Quantum Gates

## Future Work

- Adding multiple quantum gates.
- Quantum Algorithms
